<h2><li>Definition of Operating system:</li></h2>
<h3>1. An operating system is a program that controls the execution of application programs and acts as an interface between the user of a computer and the computer hardware.</h3>
<h3>2. A more common definition is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being application programs.</h3>
<h3>3. An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as memory, processors, devices, and information. The operating system correspondingly includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler, memory management module, I/O programs, and a file system.</h3>
