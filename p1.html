<h2><li>Batch Operating System:</li></h2>
<h4>The users of a batch operating system do not interact with the computer directly. Each user prepares his job on an off-line device like punch cards and submits it to the computer operator. To speed up processing, jobs with similar needs are batched together and run as a group. The programmers leave their programs with the operator and the operator then sorts the programs with similar requirements into batches. The problems with Batch Systems are as follows:-</h4>
<ol>
 <h4><li>Lack of interaction between the user and the job.</li></h4>
 <h4><li>CPU is often idle, because the speed of the mechanical I/O devices is slower than the CPU</li></h4>
 <h4><li>Difficult to provide the desired priority.</li></h4>
</ol>
<h2><li>Time sharing Operating system:</li></h2>
<h4>Each task is given some time to execute, so that all the tasks work smoothly. Each user gets time of CPU as they use single system. These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems. The task can be from single user or from different users also. The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum. After this time interval is over OS switches over to next task.</h4>
<h2><li>Distributed Operating system:</li></h2>
<h4>Distributed systems use multiple central processors to serve multiple real-time applications and multiple users. Data processing jobs are distributed among the processors accordingly. The processors communicate with one another through various communication lines (such as high-speed buses or telephone lines). These are referred as loosely coupled systems or distributed systems. Processors in a distributed system may vary in size and function. These processors are referred as sites, nodes, computers, and soon</h4>
<h2><li>Network Operating system</li></h2>
<h4>These systems run on a server and provide the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions. These type of operating systems allow shared access of files, printers, security, applications, and other networking functions over a small private network. One more important aspect of Network Operating Systems is that all the users are well aware of the underlying configuration, of all other users within the network, their individual connections etc. and thatâ€™s why these computers are popularly known as tightly coupled systems.</h4>
